# Projects:

<h3 align="center">Hardware:</h3>

**Automation of Optical Telescope using Alt-Az Mount**
   * Prepared an Hand Grinded Newtonian Telescope (4-in apparture) applying the laws of Optics, and the control system for Stellar Tracking (of 9 stars).
   * The smallest angle of Rotation was caliberated to 0.1 degrees, providing 87% accuracy in imaging of Stars.
   * This Project also recieved Best Project Award for Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI) in college, and is in Patent Process.

**Affordable Small Radio Telescope (ASRT) based Solar Observation**
   * Used an old DTH set to get the Radio Observations in Ku-Band of Satellite Spectrum, setting the Radio Telescope in affordable price. 
   * Also set a Super Heterodyne Reciever to transcieve Radio Waves and forming the Frequency (Energy) vs Time Graph to detect Solar Activities.
   * The project was presented at Inter University of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA)

**Blink Controlled Wheelchair for Differentially Abled**
   * The Project implied the locomotio of Differentially Abled Citizens, using the Blink Strength. 
   * The core technology of Signal Processing was implied to get the results. 
   * This prototype model could benifit 78% Differentially Abled Citizens.

**FM Transmitter and Radio Reciever**
   * The FM Transmitter and Reciever using RLC Circuit was created to transmit the signal over 30m radius.
   * Learnt about the Antenna Basics ranging from Yagi-Uda Antennas to Patch Antenna, by hands on implementation of Signal sent over the Transmitter to Reciever.
   * The Reciever was able to percieve the Radio Signal with only 24% introduction of Noise due to undamped System Implementation and EMI radiations

<h3 align="center">DevOps:</h3>

**RF Up/Down-Converter Design using GNU Radio and SDRs**
   * Developed a system for efficient signal conversion between different frequency bands using GNU Radio and Software Defined Radios (SDRs).
   * Contributed to the design and implementation of bandpass filters, low-noise amplifiers, oscillators, mixers, and digital signal processing engines.

**URL Enumeration of Hidden Servers over TOR**
   * Explored methods and techniques for discovering and cataloging URLs of hidden servers within the TOR network.
   * Contributed to the development of tools for accessing the TOR network, web crawling, encryption analysis, and network traffic analysis.

**Lab infrastructure for Private Institution**
   * Successfully implemented virtualized computer lab setup, saving 30% in hardware costs and achieving a 25% increase in resource utilization efficiency. 
   * Enabled simultaneous usage of six virtual machines, resulting in a 40% boost in student productivity and a 20% decrease in administrative overhead.

<h3 align="center">Software:</h3>

**Website for Antariksh:**
   * Developed upto date websites for Antariksh, the Official Astronomy Club of VI, catering needs of Article blogging, Resource sharing and Literacy.
   * Used Technologies like VITE, VueJs and API to make Website 80% faster by deploying it on Vercel Platform.

**OSProbe Kit**
   * Implemented set of Bash Scripts to monitor the System Resources, Program Utilities and Network Connections.
   * Enabled users to facilitate the gain knowledge of hidden Computer Processes and Networks.

**Butterfly Classification in Sahyadri Region**
   * A Python Application using CNN Methods to classify Butterflies in 100 classes using ResNet50 algorithm.
   * The Classification works at 94% accuracy and is viable to detect real time butterfly images.

**Host Based Network and Process Analyzer**
   * Developed a system for analyzing network and process data within a host-based environment.
   * Contributed to the design and implementation of algorithms for monitoring network connections, process activities, and system resources.
